The\n\t\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n\t\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\t\n\t\t  Terminology\n\t\t  -----------\n\t\t\n\t\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\t\n\t\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\t\n\t\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\t\n\t\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n\t\t  browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n\t\t  `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t\t\n\t\t  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n\t\t    if (err) return handleError(err);\n\t\t    handleData(data);\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  into:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t\t  let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\t\t\n\t\t  readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n\t\t  just returns the first one:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n\t\t\n\t\t  request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n\t\t    // ...\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n\t\t  second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n\t\t  as an array:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n\t\t\n\t\t  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n\t\t    // result[0] -> res\n\t\t    // result[1] -> body\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n\t\t\n\t\t  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n\t\t    // result.res\n\t\t    // result.body\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let app = require('express')();\n\t\t  let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n\t\t  environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n\t\t  function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n\t\t  denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n\t\t      cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n\t\t\n\t\t  request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n\t\t    // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n\t\t  of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t\t\n\t\t  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n\t\t    if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n\t\t    fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n\t\t      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n\t\t      console.log('done')\n\t\t    });\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\t\t\n\t\t  ```javascript\n\t\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t\t  let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\t\t  let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n\t\t\n\t\t  readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n\t\t    return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n\t\t  }).then(function(){\n\t\t    console.log('done')\n\t\t  }).catch(function(error){\n\t\t    // Handle error\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t\n\t\t  @method denodeify\n\t\t  @static\n\t\t  @for RSVP\n\t\t  @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n\t\t  its last argument.

The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class RSVP.Promise\n\t  @param {function} resolver\n\t  @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\tfunction Promise(resolver, label) {\n\t  this._id = counter++;\n\t  this._label = label;\n\t  this._state = undefined;\n\t  this._result = undefined;\n\t  this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t  config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\t\n\t  if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tPromise.cast = resolve$1; // deprecated\n\tPromise.all = all;\n\tPromise.race = race;\n\tPromise.resolve = resolve$1;\n\tPromise.reject = reject$1;\n\t\n\tPromise.prototype = {\n\t  constructor: Promise,\n\t\n\t  _guidKey: guidKey,\n\t\n\t  _onError: function _onError(reason) {\n\t    var promise = this;\n\t    config.after(function () {\n\t      if (promise._onError) {\n\t        config['trigger']('error', reason, promise._label);\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function(user){\n\t      // user is available\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Chaining\n\t    --------\n\t  \n\t    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n\t  browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n\t  `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t\n\t  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n\t    if (err) return handleError(err);\n\t    handleData(data);\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  into:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t  let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\t\n\t  readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n\t  just returns the first one:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n\t\n\t  request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n\t    // ...\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n\t  second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n\t  as an array:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n\t\n\t  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n\t    // result[0] -> res\n\t    // result[1] -> body\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n\t\n\t  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n\t    // result.res\n\t    // result.body\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let app = require('express')();\n\t  let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n\t  environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n\t  function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n\t  denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n\t      cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n\t\n\t  request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n\t    // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n\t  of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t\n\t  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n\t    if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n\t    fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n\t      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n\t      console.log('done')\n\t    });\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let fs = require('fs');\n\t  let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\t  let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n\t\n\t  readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n\t    return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n\t  }).then(function(){\n\t    console.log('done')\n\t  }).catch(function(error){\n\t    // Handle error\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @method denodeify\n\t  @static\n\t  @for RSVP\n\t  @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n\t  its last argument.
